Quaker is a web application written in React and Redux that will give us the list of Earthquakes happening around the world in an hour or day or week or month in an interactive way. I've used Recharts library to generate the graphs/charts.

Steps to run this application on your localhost
1) Clone the repository and cd into the directory
2) Run 'npm install'
3) Run 'npm run start-dev'

Now visit localhost:8081
The port number might be different, please check the terminal after the start-dev command.
